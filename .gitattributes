## 📌 1. Overview

This Incident Response Plan (IRP) outlines the structured approach ACME Athletics will take to identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from cybersecurity incidents. ACME is a fictional sports technology company that handles sensitive athlete performance data and internal analytics platforms.

---

## 🚨 2. Objectives

- Detect and contain security incidents quickly  
- Minimize operational downtime and data loss  
- Protect athlete and partner trust  
- Maintain audit trails and continuous improvement

---

## 🔐 3. Scope

Applies to all digital assets including:
- Internal servers and endpoints  
- Athlete tracking systems and cloud databases  
- Company email, mobile devices, and Slack/Zoom integrations  
- Partner-facing APIs and vendor systems

## 🧭 5. Incident Response Lifecycle

---

### 🟡 A. Identification

- Continuous monitoring of:
  - System logs (`journalctl`, `auth.log`)  
  - Network activity (via `Wireshark`, `tcpdump`)  
  - User behavior anomalies
- Indicators include:
  - Unusual login times or locations  
  - Sudden data exfiltration patterns  
  - Phishing reports from staff

---

### 🔴 B. Containment

**Short-term (immediate response):**

```bash
# Lock user account
sudo usermod -L compromised_user

# Kill suspected process
ps aux | grep suspicious_process  
sudo kill -9 [PID]

# Quarantine malware file
mv /home/user/suspicious_file /quarantine/

# Isolate machine from network
ifconfig eth0 down
````

**Network-level containment:**

```bash
# Block IP address
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.88.66 -j DROP
```

**Preserve evidence before cleanup:**

```bash
# Create disk image for forensics
sudo dd if=/dev/sda of=/mnt/forensics/host_image.img bs=1M
```

---

### 🛠️ C. Eradication

**Malware removal:**

```bash
# Install ClamAV and scan system
sudo apt-get install clamav  
clamscan -r /home/
```

**Patch exploited vulnerabilities:**

```bash
# Example: Apache vulnerability CVE-2021-41773
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade apache2
```

**Reset credentials + configs:**

* Rotate API keys, user passwords
* Review and update IAM policies
* Reconfigure firewall or VPN settings if compromised

---

### 🔁 D. Recovery

* Restore clean system backups
* Monitor restored systems closely for 72 hours
* Gradual reintroduction into production environment
* Conduct final scans using `nmap` and `netstat` to ensure no remaining exposure

```bash
# Network check
netstat -tulpn
lsof -i
```

---

### 🧾 E. Lessons Learned

* Full team debrief within 7 days
* Postmortem report stored in IR database
* Identify gaps in detection, escalation, or communication
* Update this IRP as needed

## 🧾 7. Sample Log Review

```log
Jun 17 14:22:53 server sshd[3421]: Failed password for root from 192.168.1.45 port 55874 ssh2
```

This log entry shows a brute-force SSH attempt. Multiple attempts from the same IP should trigger:

```bash
sudo fail2ban-client set sshd banip 192.168.1.45
```
